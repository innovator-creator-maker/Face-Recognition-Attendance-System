# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

This the code for the model of face recognition based attendance system.

It uses python programming langauge & KNN Algorithm for recognition purpose.

How to use this code:

1: run the train.py and make a face recognition dataset(its a numpy array)
2: then copy the path and write it in the attendance.py path location for the recognition and attendance purpose.

Tips:

For efficiency keep the dataset samall so as to decrease the time and space complexity and hence the runtime of the algorithm.
